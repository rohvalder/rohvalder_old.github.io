## Project 2 â€“ Airline Safety Executive Summary

As the presentation is meant for the executive review, the details are simple and to the point. I tried to have a storyline that makes it easy to come up with a conclusion. Avoided using bright colors and kept it more neutral. To not have the presentation monotonous, using different kinds of graphs.
