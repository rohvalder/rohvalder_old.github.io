## Project 1 – Airline Fatality Dashboard

The data is fetched from the primary source which is provided – Aviation Safety Network. It provides details about around 56 airlines and the incidents that occurred during 1985-1999 and 2000-2014 range. I have used Tableau to represent the data and have tried to use the charts that we have learned in the past.
