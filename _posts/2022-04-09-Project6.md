## Project 6 - Selection of Model based on Hotel Reviews

Hotel Review Analysis is done by analyzing the review comments, as well as the ratings, which are given on a scale of 1-5. The data is from Kaggle, an extract from Tripadvisor. In the future, multiple models will be built and then it will be trained to give results based on the review comment as input. The analysis will be done on the ratings and reviews, and a conclusion will be drawn.
