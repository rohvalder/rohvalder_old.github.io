## Project 5 â€“ Data Analysis of Breweries in the US

My project is about the breweries in the US. Looked for the population in that city, the demography around the zip code, and the count of breweries. I was able to see a pattern based on the data interpretation. The results were directed to a data frame. The data frame was used for the visualizations. I tried to use different kinds of visualizations.
