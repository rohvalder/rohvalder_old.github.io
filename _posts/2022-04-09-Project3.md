## Project 3 â€“ Flight Safety Infographic

An infographic is a perfect way to market to the public about Airline safety. I tried to keep it straight to the point. Piktochart is a great tool to build an infographic. You can be creative with the available designs and play with them along with the supported data. I stuck to only a few colors and tried to include everything as per the requirements. The output is a pdf file.
